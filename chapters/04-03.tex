Recall the autoregressive and moving averages from the previous class. We can combine these into the very powerful AR(I)MA model. Something something $I=1$.

Make sure you remember the story of Goldilocks very well.

\section{Options}
\dfn{Call Option}{The right but not the obligation to buy a security at time $T$ at strike price $K$. The price of this options contract is the premium.}
Why would I buy a call option? \begin{itemize}
	\item I think the price will go up (duh)
	\item Leverage
\end{itemize}
Selling an option is also called writing an option.

One fundamental difference between equities and options is that equities operate with prices/returns while options work with volatilities.

\dfn{Put Option}{Right but not the obligation to sell a stock at time $T$ at strike price $K$.}
