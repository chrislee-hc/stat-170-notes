\chapter{4/3/2023: Options}

\section{Some Review}
Recall the autoregressive and moving averages from the previous class. We can combine these into the very powerful AR(I)MA model. Something something $I=1$.

\section{Options}
\dfn{Call Option}{The right but not the obligation to buy a security at time $T$ at strike price $K$..}
The price of this options contract is the premium, and selling an option is also known as ``writing'' an option. Why would I buy a call option? \begin{itemize}
	\item I think the price will go up
	\item Leverage -- if the bet that I make is right, then I can get larger returns on the investment than if I invested directly in the stock. Conversely, if I am wrong, I will also lose more money than otherwise possible.
\end{itemize}

One fundamental difference between equities and options is that equities operate with prices/returns while options work with volatilities. We will see this in future classes when we study stochastic calculus and the Black-Scholes model.

\dfn{Put Option}{Right but not the obligation to sell a stock at time $T$ at strike price $K$.}
